# **FlatcapIT Mod Editor**
### Welcome to our Mod Editor github repo. Here you will find all the different Versions of our Mod Editor. We basically stay with the Unreal Engine release patterns, that means you will get one Mod Editor for every Unreal Engine Version. Please be aware that we do not support custom build Unreal Engine 4 Versions at the Moment. 

# License
### Please have a look at our EULA (https://flatcapit.com/eula.html) and privacy-policy (https://flatcapit.com/privacy-policy.html) before you use our services. You can find the download links for Connect and Sync, the counter parts for this Mod Editor on our Website and download the most recent version. If you want to go back to an older version for debugging purposes, you can do so by using Sync.

# Installation
### Installing and using our Mod Editor is very simple. After you have cloned this repo you just open the **.uproject** file with the corresponding version of Unreal Engine. You can get these from the Epic Games Launcher (https://www.epicgames.com/store/de/download). After that you can beginn to create your own Assets.

# Usage
### We have tried to keep the Mod Editor as simple as possible. You can basically not make many mistakes. A better guide on how to get started will follow soon and then be linked here!
